### Added

- **Core Kernel**
  - Agent lifecycle management (create, pause, resume, stop) with state machine validation
  - Priority-based scheduler (1-5, max 10 concurrent agents, deadlock detection)
  - SQLite-backed context persistence with auto-summarization
  - Long-term memory store with text-based retrieval
  - Permission system with 4 profiles (read-only, standard, elevated, full-access)
  - Sandbox isolation with path traversal prevention and network allowlists
  - Inter-agent communication (direct messaging, pub/sub, task delegation)
  - Observability engine (action logging, metrics, plan deviation detection)
  - WASM module system (Wasmtime-based, manifest validation, crash isolation)
  - System prerequisite validation (RAM, disk, internet)

- **Agent Execution**
  - Think→Act→Observe execution loop with tool calling
  - LLM retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
  - Tool failure recovery (errors sent back to LLM for self-correction)
  - Context window management (auto-summarize at 20+ messages)
  - Long-term memory integration (facts stored and queried across sessions)

- **LLM Adapters**
  - Azure OpenAI (with api-key auth, deployment URLs)
  - OpenAI (GPT-4, function calling)
  - Anthropic (Claude, tool_use content blocks)
  - Local (Ollama/llama.cpp via HTTP)

- **Built-in Tools**
  - `read_file` — Read file contents
  - `write_file` — Write/create files
  - `list_directory` — List directory contents
  - `http_get` — HTTP GET requests
  - `run_command` — Execute shell commands

- **Desktop Application**
  - Tauri 2 + Svelte frontend
  - Setup wizard (provider selection, API key entry)
  - Dashboard with agent cards and system metrics
  - Chat panel with tool call indicators
  - Configuration persistence (TOML)

- **Testing**
  - 160 tests (unit + property-based + integration)
  - 28 correctness properties validated via proptest
  - E2E pipeline tests with wiremock
  - Adapter-specific wiremock tests (OpenAI, Anthropic)
